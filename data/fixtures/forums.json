Long wait times, parts on backorder, and they never seem to fix the problem the first time. Starting to regret not going with Kenworth.",

We charge overnight at the yard and get about 140-150 miles per charge loaded. The drivers love how quiet and smooth it is. ROI looks good with the HVIP rebate.",
