Alot of Pete owners put unmuffled straight exhaust pipes on the trucks, hence the loudness.",

It seems like all the trucks with the more powerful engines (over 500 hp) are box model trucks. http://www.peterbilt.bc.ca/froese.jpg and not the round model. http://www.peterbilt.bc.ca/s4702.jpg 2. Why is it that when I'm going down the road, the box model peterbilts are louder than h*ll?",

We have a few in our fleet, along with a few Freightliner Classics, and now a couple Western Star 4900ex's. Doing mostly local work, climbing in and out of the truck multiple times a day, the Freightliners have held up really well, and are really driver friendly. Same goes for the Western Stars. The Peterbilts, which are 379's, have been the most troublesome. They all are 2000 or 2001 models.",
